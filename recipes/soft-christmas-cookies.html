    <p>A simple recipe for soft Christmas sugar cookies.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
      <li>Beat sugar and margarine in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat first egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg into mixture along with vanilla extract; add flour mixture and stir until dough is just combined. Wrap dough; chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.</li>

      <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
